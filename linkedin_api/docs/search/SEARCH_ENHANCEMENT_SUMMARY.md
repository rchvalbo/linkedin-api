## üí° Use Case Examples

### 1. Lead Scoring
```python
def calculate_lead_score(result):
    score = 0
    
    # Connection strength
    if result['connection_degree'] == '1st':
        score += 40
    elif result['connection_degree'] == '2nd':
        score += 25
    
    # Mutual connections
    if result['mutual_connections_count'] >= 50:
        score += 30
    elif result['mutual_connections_count'] >= 20:
        score += 20
    
    # Premium status
    if result['is_premium']:
        score += 15
    
    # Hiring status
    if result['is_hiring']:
        score += 15
    
    return score
```

### 2. Smart Filtering
```python
# Find warm leads at target companies
warm_leads = [
    lead for lead in results
    if lead['connection_degree'] in ['1st', '2nd']
    and lead['mutual_connections_count'] >= 5
    and lead['company'] in target_companies
]

# Find hiring managers
hiring_managers = [
    lead for lead in results
    if lead['is_hiring']
]
```

### 3. Personalized Outreach
```python
def generate_message(result):
    name = result['lead_name']
    mutual_count = result['mutual_connections_count']
    company = result['company']
    
    if mutual_count >= 10:
        return f"Hi {name}, I noticed we have {mutual_count} mutual connections! I'd love to connect and discuss opportunities at {company}."
    elif company:
        return f"Hi {name}, I saw you work at {company}. I'd love to connect!"
    else:
        return f"Hi {name}, I'd love to connect!"
```
